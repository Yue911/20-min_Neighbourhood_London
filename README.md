# 20-min_Neighbourhood_London

This project is inspired by the "20-minute neighbourhood" concept, which refers to areas where essential services (such as schools, hospitals, and markets) are accessible within a 20-minute journey by green transportation methods like walking and buses. The study is conducted at the borough level, using the centroid of each borough as the starting point for analysis.
